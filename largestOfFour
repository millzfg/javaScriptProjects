//This program takes an argument(arr) which has 4 sub-arrays containing 4 numbers, and takes the largest of each sub-array's number and creates a new array with the largest number in each sub-array

  let highVal;  //Variable storing highest value of each iteration of sub-arrays
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){  //Iteration of each sub-array
    highVal = arr[i][0];  //Sets the first value in each sub-array as the highest
    for(let j = 1; j < arr[i].length; j++){  //Tests the value of the first sub-array number against the remaining numbers in the array
      if(highVal < arr[i][j]){  //Condition setting new highVal if number is larger than the subsequent number 
        highVal = arr[i][j];
      }
    }

  }
  arr = newArr;  //sets the value of the old array(arr) to the new array
